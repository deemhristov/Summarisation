<h2>General</h2>

<p>Summannotator is a program for manual extraction summary creation.
It allows to select/deselect clauses to summaries simply by clicking them.</p>

<p>When we open a file in it, we can see 3 tabs, each corresponding 
to a different summary size: 20%, 10% and 5%. Clauses to choose 
from are shown in the top pane, bottom pane presents current size 
of the summary with respect to the desired size (so a 100% means
that summary is of correct size, not that we selected all the clauses).
Bottom right pane presents the summary as free text.</p>

<p>Each smaller summary must contain only clauses from the bigger one.</p>

<h2>Changing display size</h2>
<p>To change display size, choose from "Other" menu option "Change font size" 
and select desired value. For changes to have effect, you need to load the text 
again (by selecting "Open" option from "File" menu). Settings are reset to default 
after the program is closed.</p>

<h2>Format of input/output files</h2>
<p>Input file to the program should be in XML format (with the .xml)
extension. It should contain CLAUSE tags (with obligatory ID attribute),
and WORD tags. A WORD tag should contain orthgraphical form of the word
inside. Two example files (Greek and English) are enclosed with this 
application.</p>

<p>Saving the summary in program results in the creation of a file with 
the same name as the opened one, but with .summ extension instead of
.xml. File format is self-explaining, the file contains information 
about 3 summaries: 20%, 10% and 5%. Empty lines are important, and
it's better not to try to edit this file manually.</p>

<p>If we choose to open a file with existing .summ neighbour, the summary
from it will be automatically loaded.</p>
