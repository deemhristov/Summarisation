<h2>General</h2>

<p>Abstract Summary Editor is a program for manual abstract summary creation and edition.</p>

<p>When we open a file in it, int the top pane the original text to summarize is shown.
In the bottom we can see 3 tabs, each corresponding to a different summary size: 20%, 10% and 5%.
The summary of given size should be written in the right text area. The left side of the bottom
pane presents current size of the summary with respect to the desired size (so a 100% means
that summary is of correct size, not that it contains all words from the original text).</p>

<h2>Changing display size</h2>
<p>To change display size, choose from "Other" menu option "Change font size" 
and select desired value. Settings are reset to default after the program is closed.</p>

<h2>Format of input/output files</h2>
<p>Input file to the program should be in raw TXT format, with UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>Summaries are appended to the end of text after saving (and separated by special lines). 
It's better not to try to edit this file manually in normal text editor.</p>

<p>Is the summaries were saved, they are loaded the next time we open the same file.</p>
